Data Science,"The thrill of working at a start-up that is starting to scale massively is something else.

Simpl (getsimpl.com) was formed in 2015 by Nitya Sharma, an investment banker from Wall Street and Chaitra Chidanand, a tech executive from the Valley, when they teamed up with a very clear mission - to make money simple, so that people can live well and do amazing things.

Simpl is the payment platform for the mobile-first world, and weâ€™re backed by some of the best names in fintech globally (folks who have invested in Visa, Square and Transferwise), and has Joe Saunders, Ex Chairman and CEO of Visa as a board member.

Everyone at Simpl is an internal entrepreneur who is given a lot of bandwidth and resources to create the next breakthrough towards the long term vision of â€œmaking money Simplâ€.

In the background, Simpl uses big data for credit underwriting, risk and fraud modelling, all without any paperwork, and enables Banks and Non-Bank Financial Companies to access a whole new consumer market.

Responsibilities

You will be focused on making sure of data correctness and accessibility, and building scalable systems to access/process it. Another major responsibility is helping AI/ML Engineers write better code. You will also build scalable, high performance data intensive services.

Examples:

- We have data pipelines processing aggregate and statistical data. Should we store this

in Redshift, in flat files in S3, or somewhere else?

- How should we structure our data pipelines?

- We need to track various data points to identify our customers in various locations, including from different devices, and determine that two seemingly disparate users are actually the same. How can we do this efficiently and effectively?

Your job is to understand what weâ€™re trying to build, make informed choices about this and then get us going.

Example interview questions:

- Consider the query `SELECT * FROM foo INNER JOIN bar ON foo.x = bar.x WHERE foo.primary_key = ?`. What happens if you run this in Postgres? How does that differ if you run it in Redshift, or SparkSQL?

- Suppose we store a table in flat CSV files on S3. What kinds of jobs is this good for, and bad for? How is Parquet or BerkeleyDB different?

- What data structures are good for storing a graph, assuming the common query is finding a connected component?

On these questions, weâ€™re primarily interested in computer science fundamentals. A good answer might be â€œa B-Tree, with keys structured as ...â€. A bad answer might be be â€œuse Neo4J, I donâ€™t know how it works but itâ€™s fastâ€."

About Avalara

We’re building cloud-based tax compliance solutions to handle every transaction in the world.

Imagine every transaction you make — every tank of gas, cup of coffee, or pair of sneakers, every movie ticket, meal kit, or streamed song, every sensor-to-sensor ping. Nearly every time you make a purchase, physical or digital, there’s an accompanying unique and nuanced tax compliance calculation.

The logic behind calculating taxes — the rules, rates, and boundaries — is a global, layered, three-dimensional mess of complexity, with compliance dictated by governments and applied by every business, every day.

Avalara works with businesses of all sizes, all over the world — from corner stores to gigantic global retailers — to calculate tax accurately and automatically, at speeds measured in milliseconds.

That’s a massive technical challenge, in terms of scale, reliability, and complexity, and we do it better than anyone. That’s why we’re growing fast.

Headquartered in Seattle, Avalara has offices across the U.S. and around the world, in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, India, and the U.K.

Avalara is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified candidates will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, creed, religion, age, gender, national orientation, disability, sexual orientation, or any other factor protected by law."

Job Description

Now is a unique moment to join Airbus Defense and Space activities in India !

The space and defence industry is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in a world that is becoming more complex and less predictable. For instance, deploying payloads into space is becoming much cheaper, which opens up space to new commercial users and entrepreneurial business models.Unmanned aerial vehicles (“drones”) provide deep insight into the well-being of our fragile planet, and allow delivery of payloads into areas that are too dirty, dull or dangerous for human pilots.Drones also hold promise for moving people around congested cities.Meanwhile, the ramifications of conflicts around the world stretch all the way to the core of affluent Western democracies, both offline and online.Threats to critical infrastructure, payment systems and mainstream media for instance illustrate the asymmetric nature of many conflicts, requiring better security and protection in cyberspace.Meanwhile, governments are striving to improve the total cost of ownership of their existing military assets, such as military aircraft.They are also increasingly buying new assets as a service, in the process forcing a business model transformation upon their suppliers.

The Digital Platform which is being created now at Airbus Defence & Space is a crucial foundation for these transformations, as it enables promising internal and external use cases that improve operational performance, open up new markets, and ultimately contribute to making the world a safer place.

In your role, you are part of a scrum development team and build services jointly with members of other disciplines.

Expertise in SQL is all we are looking for in these positions. Of course, deep knowledge of Oracle databases is an added plus. Our philosophy is to make the life of our developers, testers and cloud team and eventually our customers as easy as possible.

Job Responsibilities

Following are the essential responsibilities of this role. It is a constantly evolving role with increased responsibilities as the business evolves
Work on varied projects within the CXM DevOps team.
Work closely with the team in India (Hyderabad) and North America (Canada and US).
Work on our CI/CD stack and make continual improvements for increased throughput and optimal use of resources.
Collaborate and Support various Scrum teams within CXN Eloqua for the solutions that our team builds for them.
Use terraform to automate build out of infrastructure on OCI
Skillsets needed

While we know that not everyone can be a master at everything, we are looking for people with interest and basic understanding of the following

Git – You are more than just a Git user. Would you know how to branch, merge, squash, stash, and patch ?

Linux – Need system level knowledge of Linux. Starting from understanding of Kernel architecture, process management and configuring a linux system ?

Windows – Everyone has done windows sometime or other. You will be doing more. Need to know Windows Services layer, APIs and probably done some sort of batch scripting on windows

Chef/Puppet – Have you done Chef or Puppet ? By that what we mean is you have written scripts using these tools, not just used them. If not, how about CFEngine, Saltstack, or Ansible ?

System Administration – Would you know how to add new windows users ? Start/Stop services , setup new windows and linux machines ? Apache

Webservers – Have you setup an Apache Webserver ? If not, how about Nginx ? Understanding of webservers and how it works would be an essential skill

Ruby/Python – You should have programmed significantly on Ruby or Python. What we are talking about are much more than writing some simple scripts or knowing the syntax. Share with us what you have done and show us how you can program in them

CI Systems – We are big on Teamcity. If you are not, don’t worry, how about Jenkins/Buildbot/Electric Commander/ Hudson/Circle or any other popular ones? Again, we are looking for someone who has modeled workflows in a CI system and has in depth administration knowledge or at least understanding of the concepts. All developers these days use CI systems, but our group supports these for 100s of developers

Databases / SQL – Being at Oracle developing enterprise systems, we need you to have a pretty good understanding of databases. We prefer Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database. If your understanding of how these databases work is minimal, we would at least want you to be a SQL expert. We expect you to know JOIN/UNION/SCHEMA/STREAM/…

Shell/Perl/Regex – Knowing Shell scripting or Perl would show us that you have solid system administration automation experience.

Java/C++/C# - Have you done any application development. While this is not a must-have, we would know you can hold your own if you have done this

Networking – We deal with very many networking challenges in our day-to-day work. While we do not expect you to be a network administrator , understanding of the basic concepts of networking is a must have.

Dockers and Containers – Being able to build and deploy images is a critical part of our operations. We expect all our stack to be containerized in the next several months. Have you heard about this technology and does it interest you ?

Terraform for OCI

Agile/Scrums/Kanban/JIRA – Devops team does agile. We have 2 week sprints and practice our development methodologies religiously. We have roadmaps, goals and challenging deliverables while managing the day-to-day support needs

Communication skills – Perhaps this is one of the most important skills that is often overlooked. Our team currently is spread across potentially 6 geographical locations and effective oral and written communication is what’s really going to make it successful. Devops @ Oracle requires people skills in supporting several people around the world and gone are the days when you are a reclusive programmer

Why Cisco:


#WeAreCisco, where each person is outstanding, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We accept digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

Action Plan and timetable for the implementation of the strategy were
adopted in April 2011. A key component of the Action Plan is the

capacity for information exchange between executive authorities on border
management related issues and on border control operational procedures;
- Strengthen the international cooperation between the South Caucasus
countries, EU Member States and other international stakeholders for
securing the legal movement of people and goods;
- Ensure the modern equipment is provided to 3 BCPs;
- Ensure that EU adopted best IBM standards and gender-sensitive policies
and procedures are employed by the border management agencies;
- Ensure that the EU-standards on IBM concept are operational at

- Ensure that transparency, accountability and integrity of border
management agencies is improved.

About You

You have an allergy to poor user experience, confusing UI layouts, and clunky, inconsistent tooling. You love to build sleek, easily extended interfaces that explain the deep, complicated back-ends behind them to your users; one of your greatest secret joys is seeing somebody perform a previously-dangerous task in production, but with a new UI that sits atop fresh automation which removes the sharp edges. You relish the idea of building, modifying, extending, and where needed replacing tooling that supports a global infrastructure upon which some of the world's biggest companies run their businesses. You know good architecture from bad, are willing to hold your position while educating peers about your approach, and are just as happy to find a new and better approach as to be right in the first place.You design, code, and deliver production-quality user experiences on the technologies our customers interact with (e.g., web, mobile, device, etc.). The software you build is secure, accessible, maintainable, scalable, performant, and operationally excellent. You possess skill in UX design, front-end languages, libraries, frameworks.

Our Product



Clarisights is a SaaS product that enables marketers to gain better insight from their ads and analytics data. Marketers have to deal with data incoming from multiple siloed sources such as ad networks, web analytics, in-app analytics and inhouse customer data. Collating all this data, exporting it, and later analysing it is often an manual job which is tedious, error prone and very limited. Clarisights solves this problem by stitching in data aggregation, data warehousing and data visualisation into one seamless interface. Marketers can connect their data sources to our platform, streaming all the ad and analytics data to our backend, then can run computations on that data, have custom visualisations, drill down / roll up, and query by any other metric. It gives marketers superpowers by helping them make sense of all their data without any of the pain.

The Role



We hit product market fit in early 2018, bagged a few top tier customers and even managed to close a $2 Million seed round from top European VCs. We're embarking on the next phases of our revolutionary business intelligence product and need dedicated and world-class frontend web expertise to help build and scale a highly performant web frontend.

We are looking for a frontend developer who has experience in building and shipping frontend applications, ideally fairly involved frontend apps. He/She should have good working knowledge of Javascript, browser and related technologies. Knowledge of best practices in frontend architecture, including performance, accessibility and usability.

This role will involve -


Understanding the product inside out, figure out the major components of the product and how they interact with each other.

Build user interfaces that are consistent, accessible, pixel-perfect, and fast, that are customisable as per the varying use cases. Create reusable and maintainable frontend systems and abstractions.

Our dashboards heavily use different visualisations and each tables handles 100s of thousands of rows. Architect and build highly interactive interfaces and visualisations that scale with optimal performance.

Work with React, ES6, TypeScript and HTML/CSS to build and maintain new Clarisights' features.

Dive deep into the usage of coding patterns and contribute in curating a library of reusable components that can be used

Experimenting with new libraries, APIs and patterns - figuring out which ones are a good fit for us to help us scale.



Our Tech Stack



On the backend we use Ruby on Rails for the API, MongoDB and Postgres for the datastore, Docker and Kubernetes for the infrastructure, all hosted on the Google cloud platform.

For the frontend we use Webpack, Flow, Babel, ReactJS, Redux and Redux Saga. We also use react virtualised and highcharts for data visualisation. We test using Jest and Enzyme.

REQUIREMENTS



Our job doesnt begin with a feature request or end with a deploy - our ideal team member is someone who is a self-initiator, identifies what we should work on, figures out how best to tackle it, and isnt satisfied until its done right. He/she will have experience build frontend applications and would have a good knowledge of Javascript, browser and related technologies.


1+ Years of experience building frontend applications. Ideally you've shipped something in production (either in a company or your own projects). Having built more things is an advantage.

Familiarity with any modern frontend JavaScript framework (Angular, Vue, React, etc) and tooling (Webpack, Parcel, Babel). Having dabbled in React previously is a bonus.

Working knowledge of semantic html and css. You don't have to be a frontend guru, but knowing what to search for when you're stuck is a helpful skill to have.

Computational thinking and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

You understand version control and have used something like git.

Good sense of UI design and/or backend knowledge is a plus.


BENEFITS




You will be joining us at the perfect stage in our company - were neither a struggling startup, nor a slow moving established company. Weve found product market fit and are doubling down and scaling our product. You not only get to see all aspects of the product but also learn how a company is built and scaled from ground up. Expect to have three years worth of experience compressed into one.

Youll have all the opportunity to tackle hard problems, experiment and take risks - even if it means failing. The engineering problems here will let you deal with scale, performance and complexity. You will be helping us scale our data ingestion pipeline for handling petabytes of data as opposed to hundreds of GB of data it handles today; handle huge amounts of data to visualise in the react frontend while still keeping everything responsive and highly performant.

Work with a great team of people who have a track record of shipping and scaling some solid products at companies like Facebook, Google, Nutanix and Freshdesk. We contribute to popular OSS libraries and are planning to open source a few of our own open source tools - both backend and frontend.

We care about your personal development - you get access to books, courses and subscriptions, we get in external mentors when necessary. We encourage you to attend meetups and conferences. We just dont want you to build great stuff but want you to become great at building great stuff.

Ideate, experiment, share your work with others. We will encourage you to write blog posts, give talks and contribute to open source. If youve done something brilliant we dont hide it, in fact we go out of our way to promote it to the external world.

We are like a big family! Weve turned a nice bungalow into our office and even have a full time cook. Were redoing parts of our office, you get to decide how the office you work in looks like.

We have a flexible and open culture. Bring your own device - Mac / Windows / Linux. We provide you with the monitors, keyboards and anything else you need to get stuff done. You will have great pay, a flexible schedule, work from home option and generous vacation time.

Since 1984, Cisco has led in the innovation of IP-based networking technologies such as routing, switching, security, unified communications, video, and wireless. Our responsible business practices help ensure business sustainability and environmentally conscious operations and products.

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A block-chain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box! But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

Machine Learning,"At Uber, we ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion. We take on big problems to help drivers, riders, delivery partners, and eaters get moving in more than 600 cities around the world.

We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where everyone and everything can move independently. If you have the curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let’s move the world forward, together.

About the Role

This position is in the India Maps team. Maps plays a foundational role in Uber; many of the core Uber product functions are built on top of or leverage Maps functionality directly or indirectly. India Maps team develops high-priority, critical pieces of functionality for the Maps organization, working on a variety of things from Routing observability, diagnostics, algorithmic map error detection, experiment simulation platform, basemap data platform to Uber Places platform, Legoland, etc.

This position falls in the Routing vertical of the Maps organization. The Maps Routing stack in Uber is a set of technologies that produces the best route from point A to point B and estimates time (ETAs) for all Uber. This includes modeling traffic on roads from GPS locations, sophisticated routing algorithms with a variety of cost functions, turn-by-turn navigation experience, and machine-learned ETAs predictions. This also requires building big data pipelines -- both batch and real-time -- to process and ingest map data, computing ETAs, traffic, etc. Our routing solutions powers many Uber products ranging from pickup ETAs, driver-rider matching (Uber Pool and others), fare estimation, EATs, Freight, Bicycles and more to come!

This role is critical to our Maps product as a whole -- when map data does not reflect the real world accurately, all the services built on top of it are adversely affected causing degradation of customer experience and safety issues. As the real world keeps changing, any map, regardless of initial quality, will always have errors; and the ability to apply ML and algorithms to detect and fix map errors is one of the most scalable ways for us to keep the maps accurate.
What You’ll Do
For this job position, we are looking for a strong ML engineer who can solve challenges in Maps domain by applying ML techniques. The particular problem that this engineer will work on is to automatically detect many kinds of errors in our global map data by leveraging the huge amount of signals that is available at Uber (ex: terabytes of GPS traces, re-routes, traffic patterns, customer tickets, satellite/streetside imagery, etc). This problem is made even more challenging given that we need to detect these errors with high precision (to minimize costs of manual review) and high recall (to detect most of the significant errors present in the map).

A successful Maps ML engineer would have
6 years of experience with Machine Learning, Software Engineering in a highly competitive environment
Ability to translate a real-life problem into a ML model (deep learning, decision trees, bayesian models, etc)
Practical knowledge of feature engineering, model training, model tuning, model evaluation, etc.
Experience with designing a scalable ML System including feature store, training pipeline, model serving, model deployment, experimentation framework
Demonstrated application of ML techniques in the industry for a problem at scale with fruitful results.
Experience using machine learning libraries or platforms such as Tensorflow, Caffe, Theano, Scikit-Learn, Spark ML, etc.
Some knowledge of backend software engineering including coding and working with scalable software services and systems.
Bonus points for Geospatial experience: Familiarity with geospatial datasets and services, such as maps, local search, points of interest and business listings data, mobile device location and GPS traces would be a plus but is not required.

Why join us
Truly unique set of problems: The nature of Uber’s business imposes a distinct set of constraints on Maps that cannot be found elsewhere.
Teammates: Work with empathetic, smart and motivated teammates in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.
Impact: Mapping is central to Uber’s success. You’ll be working on mission critical projects that are visible both inside and outside of Uber. The map error detection project is a key project in the Mapping org and has high visibility and impact.
High scalability engineering: Build world class engineering for high throughput and low latency distributed systems. We take ownership in creating elegant and reliable code.
Fun problem solving: We love solving challenging problems with cutting edge algorithms. We move fast and build things that have never been built before."

Insight Jedi is hiring a Machine Learning expert.

What do we do?
There are a lot of companies that do machine learning. Lots of companies also build tools to manage and deploy machine learning models. But most of the “learning” part of machine learning is still human driven. Once a problem is posed, everything -- data cleanup, feature engineering, model building -- is still mostly done manually by data scientists. There are no tools that help domain experts e.g. business users or analysts, to do all these things automatically -- one would still need to know enough coding and statistics to make them work.
We started thinking about this problem a few years back. A couple of years back we finally were able to build a platform that automates everything -- users just bring their data, answer a few questions, and get very accurate predictive models in minutes or hours, not weeks and months -- completely automatically! The platform doesn’t care where the data came from or how the data looks like.
Insight Jedi’s ability to build models completely automatically has enabled us to solve some of the toughest business problems -- across multiple domains. Our platform has been able to predict which cell phone towers are about to fail for a large European tele-communications company; it was able to measure the impact of delivery delays in logistics to buying patterns of customers from transactions for a well known e-commerce company -- connecting for the first time, the data in two silos; it has drastically improved collections for healthcare companies by model-driven prioritizations; it has automatically alerted of anomalous patterns from almost a million metrics being tracked by one of the largest global CPG companies, helping them address issues months before they would have identified.
*
How can we work together?
On any given day, we spend our time doing lots of things. If you join our team, you will be working with us on each of these. We have made a ton of progress building this platform from the ground-up, and have had actual impact on our client’s businesses. But there’s a lot to be done.
Large part of our job is to understand the scale of automation needed to convert a complex but pretty generic business problem to a collection of algorithms working in tandem. As an example, when we are automatically surfacing anomalies for hundreds of time-series metrics, we are not doing just that. We are automating extracting anomalies from any time series data, we are automating finding patterns in anomalies, and we are automating what to say about the future by looking at patterns in anomalies. You will be contributing in combining otherwise isolated algorithms to deliver automated solutions.
As an expert, you have read, implemented or devised lots of algorithms. But a lot of these algorithms never see real life since the path to automating it to a large number of real-world problems is not obvious. Our key premise -- that everything including feature engineering, model selection, model estimation will be automated -- and, our repeated interactions of real-life problems from our clients -- gives us an open playground to bring large scale adoption of all these algorithms. You will help in bringing these algorithms to “life”.
We design our own algorithms using any mathematical building blocks e.g. EM and variational methods, Bayesian models and appropriate priors, Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, regularisation, gradient descent, matrix factorisation, etc. We have a good understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory to understand academic research papers in statistics, machine learning, and computer science. It is expected that you have some formal training in this.
We code, write tests, tune for speed and memory consumption, and finally, document and deploy algorithms to production. We code in python (and Cython), but if you are proficient in at least one language, we are confident that you will be able to contribute to our production code.
We scale algorithms to large datasets in way shorter time by designing them from scratch. It might even mean certain tradeoffs and understanding of computing e.g. making use of embarrassingly parallel methods, map-reduce frameworks, or tricks of linear algebra, etc. Knowledge of algorithmic and computing fundamentals which allow scaling will be favorable.
Location:
We are OK with remote work, at least initially, although we expect familiarity with tools like github to make remote work more efficient.

What will you be working on?
Insight Jedi builds custom applications on the platform which solve some of the hardest business problems for our clients. Your responsibility will be to understand the business problem and use the platform components to automate the complete data science workflow for the problem. Our deliverable to our clients is an application which just ingests data and automatically builds models, throws insights as visualisations, and even auto-update the model when new data comes in. You will be responsible for everything in the backend that does this. This includes:
Framing the business problem as the most appropriate machine learning problem.
Incorporating platform components to build what we call a custom recipe. We have a well-maintained but complex and large code-base -- you will be understanding how each component is related with others. Custom recipes almost always have multiple sources of data coming in -- you will be structuring the data such that the automated feature engineering and filtering engines can take over (it is called the Signal Factory in Insight Jedi).
Building insights from the model and the data which answers all the big and small questions which define the business problem. Insights are typically outputs of predictive models, small standalone statistical models, or just data being shown in specific ways.
Contribute to developing core algorithms of the Insight Jedi platform.
Help the rest of the team to respond to customer requests for support, or questions on how things work and why.
What will you bring in?
You will have good knowledge of python.
You will have a basic understanding of machine learning algorithms.
You will have strong communication skills to understand what needs to be done, ask questions to flesh out ideas, and even document work when needed.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colourful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
