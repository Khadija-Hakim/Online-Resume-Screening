# Online-Resume-Screening
Online resume screening is my final year project which is a web-based application using machine learning techniques (KNN algorithm).
The application takes multiple resumes and one job description, makes comparison and results ranking of resumes by evaluating them on basis of Job description.
We return five best resumes out of hundreds of resumes that are uploaded in system.
